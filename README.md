MapingObjectsFramework
======================

What if you want to copy all or some of the properties from one object to another object? What if you want to convert from your Data Layer to your Domain Layer? Using MappingObjectsFramework that task is very easy, just mark the properties that you want to transfer and it will copy them for you, also if you want to use a specific function to map properties from a data type to another completed different data type, you only need to tell to the framework how this conversion is done and vuala!
